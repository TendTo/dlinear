 * Bound of a linear program variable.
 *
 * This is a simple enum class that describes the bound of a linear program variable.
 * It is used to limit the values it can assume.
 * The bounds are:
 * - U: upper bound
 * - SU: strict upper bound
 * - B: both upper and lower bound are equal (fixed)
 * - D: variable must be different from the bound
 * - L: lower bound
 * - SL: strict lower bound
 * - F: free variable
 *
 * If the bound is strict, it means that the variable cannot assume the bound value.
 * When using delta complete solvers, strict bounds can be relaxed to non-strict bounds.
