\begin{abstract}
    \dlinear is an SMT solver for the theory of linear real arithmetic (QF\_LRA).
    It uses floating point arithmetic to verify the feasibility of the linear constraints instead of the traditional fully rational approach utilised by other state of the art SMT solvers,
    while still guaranteeing an exact solution.
    Furthermore it allows for delta-complete reasoning, which relaxes the constraints by an arbitrary factor to produce the output faster.

\section{Introduction}

SAT and SMT solvers are used to check the satisfiability of logical formulas and to solve constraints over a variety of theories.
The tool presented in this paper will focus on the theory of linear real arithmetic (QF\_LRA)\footnote{SMT-LIB officially supported logics: \url{https://smt-lib.org/logics.shtml}}.
The area of application we are interested in is the verification of big Neural Networks (NNs) and other machine learning models.
The input space of these models is often very large, and the constraints that need to be verified are often piecewise linear.
State-of-the-art SMT solvers such as Z3~\cite{ref:z3} and CVC5~\cite{ref:cvc5} already fully support the (QF\_LRA) theory.
Their approach uses a rational numerical representation applied to a specialised Simplex-based~\cite{ref:simplex} solver to guarantee an exact solution and support strict inequalities, usually ignored by LP solvers.
Unfortunately, rational arithmetic operations do not offer a constant time complexity. % TODO: find a better source or add empirical evidence
Unlike floating point arithmetic, the time required to complete the computation depends on the size of the input and the algorithm used \cite{ref:fft-mult}, hence it can slow down the calculation significantly.
