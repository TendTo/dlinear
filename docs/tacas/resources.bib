  abstract     = {We introduce the notion of ``$\delta$-complete decision procedures'' for solving SMT problems over the real numbers, with the aim of handling a wide range of nonlinear functions including transcendental functions and solutions of Lipschitz-continuous ODEs. Given an SMT problem ϕ and a positive rational number $\delta$, a $\delta$-complete decision procedure determines either that ϕ is unsatisfiable, or that the ``$\delta$-weakening'' of ϕ is satisfiable. Here, the $\delta$-weakening of ϕ is a variant of ϕ that allows $\delta$-bounded numerical perturbations on ϕ. We establish the existence and complexity of $\delta$-complete decision procedures for bounded SMT over reals with functions mentioned above. We propose to use $\delta$-completeness as an ideal requirement for numerically-driven decision procedures. As a concrete example, we formally analyze the DPLL{\textlangle}ICP{\textrangle} framework, which integrates Interval Constraint Propagation in DPLL(T), and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for its $\delta$-completeness. We discuss practical applications of $\delta$-complete decision procedures for correctness-critical applications including formal verification and theorem proving.},

We also present a new and simple approach for solving strict inequalities. Experimental results show substantial performance improvements over existing tools that use other Simplex-based solvers in DPLL(T) decision procedures. The new solver is even competitive with state-of-the-art tools specialized for the difference logic fragment.},

  abstract     = {We first introduce Abstract DPLL, a rule-based formulation of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) procedure for propositional satisfiability. This abstract framework allows one to cleanly express practical DPLL algorithms and to formally reason about them in a simple way. Its properties, such as soundness, completeness or termination, immediately carry over to the modern DPLL implementations with features such as backjumping or clause learning.We then extend the framework to Satisfiability Modulo background Theories (SMT) and use it to model several variants of the so-called lazy approach for SMT. In particular, we use it to introduce a few variants of a new, efficient and modular approach for SMT based on a general DPLL(X) engine, whose parameter X can be instantiated with a specialized solver SolverT for a given theory T, thus producing a DPLL(T) system. We describe the high-level design of DPLL(X) and its cooperation with SolverT, discuss the role of theory propagation, and describe different DPLL(T) strategies for some theories arising in industrial applications.Our extensive experimental evidence, summarized in this article, shows that DPLL(T) systems can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art tools, frequently even in orders of magnitude, and have better scaling properties.},

First, we define a new concept called formal tableau, which leads to derive easily the dual solution from the latest primal table; without any distinction between the original variables and the slack ones. Second, we propose a new method for initializing the simplex algorithm. Unlike the two-phase and the big-M methods, our technique does not involve artificial variables. The computational results reveal that this new method is very favorable especially when the number of artificial variables is significant. Finally, this method will be combined with the notion of formal tableau leading naturally to a second new approach.},
