    In this thesis we present a study and improvements over the \dlinearfour SMT delta solver.
    We will start by introducing the SMT problems, its applications and some state of the art algorithms used to solve it efficiently. \\
    Then we delve deep in the work done by the ph.d student Martin, the \dlinearfour solver \cite{repo:dlinear}, in turn inspired by the dReal4 solver \cite{paper:dreal} \cite{repo:dreal}. \\
    We aim to provide a detailed description of the software, its architecture and the choices made to ensure both correctness and efficiency. \\
    The objective is to build upon what is already present, adding some useful python binding and try to further improve the performances. \\
    Finally we will present the results of our experiments with the use of benchmarks and the comparison with other solvers.
