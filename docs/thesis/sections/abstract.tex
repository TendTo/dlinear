\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis presents a study and improvements over the \dlinearfour SMT delta solver.
We will start by introducing the SMT problems, their applications and some state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve them efficiently.
Then we delve deep into the work done by the PhD student Martin, the \dlinearfour solver, in turn, inspired by the dReal4 solver.

We aim to provide a detailed description of the software, its architecture and the choices made to ensure correctness and efficiency.
The objective is to build upon what is already present, add some useful \texttt{python} binding, and improve performance.
Finally, we will present the results of our experiments with the use of benchmarks to allow the comparison with other solvers.
