# TODO

- [x] Fix qsoptex Farkas ray
    - [x] Relegate qsoptex to compilation flag
- [x] Make sure the solution match between the two test_solvers
- [x] Try what happens by removing `Expand` from `Formula`
    - It can be done only for mps files, since the structure of the formula is not always plain otherwise
- [x] Add inequality support
- [ ] Clean up benchmarking suite
- [ ] Clean up `pydlinear`
- [ ] Remove unused Config parameters
- [ ] Improve nolog options
- [x] Make the sat return type a struct
- [x] Separate smt time between sat and theory
- [x] Sort bounds by value so that it is possible to invalidate just the ones on one side
    - [x] Sorted container for the bounds
    - [x] Find the value of the violated bound for infeasible problems
- [x] Store the value for each bit of the bit iterator and re-use it for next iterations
- [ ] Optimise situations where multiple nq constraints are violated at the same time
- [ ] Linked variables for bound checking
- [x] Multiple explanations for invalid bounds
- [x] Heuristics options
- [x] In the presence of eq bounds, they should be the only one returned by the active_bounds() method
- [ ] Optimal explanation when all nq constraints combination have been explored
- [ ] Include a starting iterator when searching lower and upper bounds, so that the search can be resumed from the last
  point
- [x] Reduce the number of copies of inf and ninf bounds in the bound vector
- [ ] Use c++20 format instead of the external library
    - [ ] Use Ubuntu 23.04+ for gcc 13+ support
- [ ] Return multiple explanations instead of just one when dealing with active constraints
- [ ] Improve iterations over nq bounds
- [ ] Add symbolic preprocessor for constraints in the form of $x \lessgtr y$
- [ ] Remove completely free variables, especially from nq constraints
